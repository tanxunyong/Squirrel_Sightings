## Functions

This **Squirrel Sighting Tracking Webapplication** is based on Django development and keeps track of all the known and recorded squirrels in 2018 at the Central Park. In this webapplication, the squirrel tracking dataset is imported. Users can add, delete, edit and view the statistics of Squirrel Sighting data and get the view of all the squirrel sightings on a map.

Eccentric billionaire Joffrey Hosencratz just purchased the web development company we work for. Weâ€™ve met him once in an elevator and he relayed that his most recent trip to Sedona, AZ has left him in a bit of trouble. See, he fancies the show [**Rick and Morty**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5SU_K-GFKk/) and a particular scene coupled with a traumatic childhood squirrel experience and a bad crystal bath experience in Sedona as left him wanting. 

He would like to start keeping track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park. Therefore we are asked to build an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow his team to add, update, and delete squirrel data.
