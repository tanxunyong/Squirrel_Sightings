## Functions

This **Squirrel Sighting Tracking Webapplication** is based on Django development and keeps track of all the known and recorded squirrels in 2018 at the Central Park as a starting observation. In this webapplication, the squirrel tracking dataset is imported. Users can add,delect, edit and view the statistics of Squirrel Sighting data and get the visualization of the geographic information of all the squirrel sightings generalized in the map.

## Dataset

The squirrel sighting data for this webapplication can be imported from [**2018 Central Park Squirrel Census**](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/data), which was collected and published by the [**Squirrel Census Comminity**](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) in 2019. 

This dataset contains data from 3,023 different squirrel sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans at the Central Park.

## Detaild Background

Eccentric billionaire Joffrey Hosencratz just purchased the web development company we work for. Weâ€™ve met him once in an elevator and he relayed that his most recent trip to Sedona, AZ has left him in a bit of trouble. See, he fancies the show Rick and Morty and a particular scene coupled with a traumatic childhood squirrel experience and a bad crystal bath experience in Sedona as left him wanting. 

He would like to start keeping track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park. Therefore we are asked to build an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow his team to add, update, and delete squirrel data.
